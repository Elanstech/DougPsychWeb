                    <p>I am a Positive Psychologist and Teacher of Transcendental Meditation. It is from this philosophic perspective of the "Psyche" or soul that I focus on issues related to family and individual problems of trauma, abandonment, addiction, career, and relationships. I address feelings of emptiness, difficulties in managing emotions, relationships, anger, anxiety, and depression in order to increase your self-awareness or consciousness about the impact of your behavior on creating change in the world.</p>
                    <p>What I enjoy most about my work is that it changes people at a very deep existential level. As a result of putting you in touch with this deep awareness, you can alleviate depression and anxiety naturally, prevent addiction, and come into contact with your real passion and purpose in life.</p>

            <div class="uniqueness-content" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p>My uniqueness as a psychologist comes with life experience. I am both a psychotherapist and a life and business coach. I help people heal from psychological problems, but also provide support for finding happiness, the right career and right mate. I provide marital evaluations for people having issues within their marriages to help them achieve success in relationships. I have been happily married for over 35 years which helps me in my family and couples/marriage therapy work.</p>
                
                <div class="office-description">
                    <p>My office is in Rego Park, Queens, NY in a relatively urban area. Clients can expect to feel comfortable and at ease with me. My office is decorated with warm colorful paintings as well as Chinese and Japanese artifacts. My practice style is goal-oriented. I use a combination of Positive Psychology, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Gestalt, and family therapy based on mindfulness and meditation as a holistic device to improve mood, awareness and behavior.</p>
                </div>

                <p>In the therapy session, I reflect back to my clients a feeling of caring and unconditional acceptance. I create rapport and ease and exhibit a gentle curiosity about their lives in a way that makes them feel listened to and respected. This greater awareness improves how they feel about themselves and enhances their decision-making ability, providing a better perspective on issues which may be causing them pain. I also help motivate my clients to express themselves fully and become happier and more resilient in the face of daily challenges at work, at home, or in relationships. My specialties include couples and marriage counseling, substance abuse, hypnotherapy and pain management.</p>

      <p>
        I am a Positive Psychologist and Teacher of Transcendental Meditation. It is from this
        philosophic perspective of the “Psyche” or soul that I focus on issues related to family
        and individual problems of trauma, abandonment, addiction, career, and relationships.
        I address feelings of emptiness, difficulties in managing emotions, relationships, anger,
        anxiety, and depression in order to increase your self-awareness or consciousness about
        the impact of your behavior on creating change in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I enjoy most about my work is that it changes people at a very deep existential
        level. As a result of putting you in touch with this deep awareness, you can alleviate
        depression and anxiety naturally, prevent addiction, and come into contact with your
        real passion and purpose in life.

    <!-- How I Am Different -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2 class="section-heading">HOW I AM DIFFERENT?</h2>
      <p>
        My uniqueness as a psychologist comes with life experience. I am both a psychotherapist
        and a life and business coach. I help people heal from psychological problems, but also
        provide support for finding happiness, the right career, and the right mate. I provide
        marital evaluations for people having issues within their marriages to help them achieve
        success in relationships. I have been happily married for over 35 years, which helps me in
        my family and couples/marriage therapy work.
      </p>
      <p>
        My office is in Rego Park, Queens, NY in a relatively urban area. Clients can expect to
        feel comfortable and at ease with me. My office is decorated with warm, colorful paintings
        as well as Chinese and Japanese artifacts. My practice style is goal-oriented. I use a
        combination of Positive Psychology, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Gestalt, and family
        therapy based on mindfulness and meditation as a holistic device to improve mood,
        awareness, and behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the therapy session, I reflect back to my clients a feeling of caring and unconditional
        acceptance. I create rapport and ease and exhibit a gentle curiosity about their lives in
        a way that makes them feel listened to and respected. This greater awareness improves how
        they feel about themselves and enhances their decision-making ability, providing a better
        perspective on issues which may be causing them pain. I also help motivate my clients to
        express themselves fully and become happier and more resilient in the face of daily
        challenges at work, at home, or in relationships. My specialties include couples and
        marriage counseling, substance abuse, hypnotherapy, and pain management.
